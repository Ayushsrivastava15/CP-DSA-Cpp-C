# Data-structures-and-algorithms
All the basic and advanced data structures and algorithms implemented either in C or C++. This is the part of my data structures and analysis of algorithms laboratory work in which I wrote the following codes by myself. Any contributions and PRs' having some new algorithms and using some different data structures are most welcome to enhance the diversity of the current repository.
I have a very good resource of ds algo and competitive progamming questions

This repo has too many good questions for programmers. I think this may help
